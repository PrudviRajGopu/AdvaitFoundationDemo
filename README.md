This project demonstrates an image grid with lazy loading . It loads images from simulated URLs and supports efficient memory and disk caching for smooth scrolling performance.

Prerequisites :
Xcode 15
Swift 5 

Installing : 
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the AdvaitFoundation.xcodeproj file.
Build and run the project in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device.

Usage
Once the project is running, you'll see an App Main screen with some images and on clicking the start button you will be navigated to image grid displaying images loaded from simulated URLs. As you scroll through the grid, new images will be loaded dynamically, providing a seamless browsing experience.

Instructions :
Scroll vertically through the image grid to load more images.
Images are loaded lazily, ensuring optimal performance and efficient use of system resources.
Memory and disk caching mechanisms are implemented to improve performance and reduce data usage.
